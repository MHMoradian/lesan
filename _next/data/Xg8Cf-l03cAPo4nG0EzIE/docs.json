The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\n\n- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.\n- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\n**easda**\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n  - Item 2a\n  - Item 2b\n\n  ```javascript\n  function add() {\n    return true;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  - [x] header\n\n| First Header                | Second Header                |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |\n| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |\n","title":"Two Forms of Pre-rendering","date":"2020-03-01"}},"__N_SSG":true}
